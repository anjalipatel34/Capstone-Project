Academic Capstone Project
Current Scenario
The Mental Health department wants to modernize the patient registration process. Currently, they use paper forms where they enter all the necessary information such as age, gender, reason for visit, addiction information, past admissions etc. for each patient. This process is tedious and doesn’t allow them to analyze the data on a large scale. The Mental Health department wants to move the data into a central repository where it is stored for easy access and analysis.
Project Details
Moving forward, the organisation wants to create a database that will allow them to electronically store all the information that they are filling out in the paper form. The database also needs to store the rest of the patient’s demographic information so that it presents the complete picture of the mental health patient. 
The project team will have to analyze the paper forms and business processes of the department and come with an ERD that covers all these areas. 
Once the database is built, the organisation wants to create an automated process of transferring historical information into the database. To do that, the data needs to be mapped to the new database fields. The project team will be creating data dictionaries and mapping documents to complete this task. Also, the project team will research on various ETL tools available and come up with the best solution to meet the needs of the department.
The organisation also wants to design a dashboard that will allow them to monitor the patients. The process will require analyzing the data and choosing indicators that are important for the Mental Health program. It will be nice to have some analysis done that highlights the correlation between certain factors (such as income, addictions) and the possibility of readmissions.
The project team will be able to choose the tool to build the dashboard. The tool has to be compatible with the choice of database and will be part of the initial planning of the project.
